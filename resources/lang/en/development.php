I like to prove myself that even a boring and tedious at a glance working task can be converted into something to which you will return with pleasure throughout the time of work.<br />
I think that I am very lucky to do what I like and what in my opinion and, more importantly, in the opinion of satisfied customers, I\'m good at doing.<br />
My motto in programming is the phrase "Language does not matter," because I believe that architecture is more important than the platform and because I\'m sure that a competent developer should be able to write first-class code in any language and for any platform.
